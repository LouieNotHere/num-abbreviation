# Large Number Abbreviation
A script that uses larger number abbreviations using JavaScript.

# Purpose
What does this exactly do? This can especially be used for html projects, or other projects.

With this script, you can make any value with the `abbreviateNumber()` function, but make sure the value is inside the parentheses of the function.

You can also put values with any number value, why not try it yourself?
